<p><b>About <i>Slave Voyages</i></b></p>
<p> According to the website: "<i>This digital memorial raises questions about the largest slave trades in history and offers access to the documentation available to answer them. European colonizers turned to Africa for enslaved laborers to build the cities and extract the resources of the Americas. They forced millions of mostly unnamed Africans across the Atlantic to the Americas, and from one part of the Americas to another. Analyze these slave trades and view interactive maps, timelines, and animations to see the dispersal in action"</i>.</p>
<p>The site has two other databases: <i>Trans-Atlantic</i> and <i>Intra-American</i>, in addition to a very rich collection of images.</p>
